# KORA Format Generator

This Application is used for generating all those formats used in the
Krayon Open Render API

Honestly most of them are useless, but who really cares. They still got options.

This poorly written code simply spits out a rust enum (that can be used in a rust project's source code)

## Building
Use Gradle to build like this:
`gradle build`

## Running
Also use Gradle to run the Kotlin Application; like this:
`gradle run`

## Contributing
Don't.
